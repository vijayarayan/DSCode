/**Implement int sqrt(int x).

	Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

	Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

	Example 1:

	Input: 4
	Output: 2
	Example 2:

	Output: 2
	Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
